A Jellyfin metadata plugin that fetches anime metadata directly from Crunchyroll, with intelligent season and episode mapping designed to match how most users organize their libraries.

## ✨ Features

- **Series Metadata**: Title, overview, release year, genres, and age rating
- **Season Metadata**: Season titles and descriptions
- **Episode Metadata**: Title, overview, runtime, and air date
- **Images**: Posters, backdrops, and episode thumbnails
- **Multi-language Support**: English, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, and more

---

## 🎯 Problems This Plugin Solves

### Split Seasons (AniDB-style behavior)

Some metadata providers treat each season as a separate series. This plugin avoids that by:

- Automatically mapping Jellyfin seasons to Crunchyroll seasons
- Keeping all seasons grouped under a single series entry

---

### Continuous Episode Numbering

Crunchyroll sometimes uses continuous episode numbering across seasons.

Example:

- **Jujutsu Kaisen**: Season 2 starts at episode 25 on Crunchyroll
- **Typical Jellyfin library**: Season 2 starts at episode 1

This plugin uses **automatic episode offset calculation**, ensuring:

- `S02E01` in Jellyfin → Crunchyroll Episode 25 ✅
- `S02E02` in Jellyfin → Crunchyroll Episode 26 ✅

- Use manual identification if needed
- Confirm the anime is available on Crunchyroll

### Incorrect language

- Verify language settings in the plugin configuration
- Some titles may not be localized in all languages

### Episode mismatch

- Ensure episode offset mapping is enabled
- Verify that each season starts at episode 1 locally

### Debug Logs

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

### Plugin Versioning

Jellyfin reads the plugin version from the **compiled .NET assembly**, not from `manifest.json` or GitHub releases.

- The `.csproj` file contains default version properties (`Version`, `AssemblyVersion`, `FileVersion`)
- The CI workflow injects the Git tag version into the assembly at build time
- `manifest.json` provides version history for updates and changelog display (but not the displayed version)

If the plugin shows as `1.0.0.0` in Jellyfin:
1. Check that the assembly was built with the correct `-p:Version=X.X.X.0` parameter
2. Verify the `.csproj` has explicit version properties as a fallback
